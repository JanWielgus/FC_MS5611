# FC_MS5611
 Arduino MS5611 library based on the [Joop Brokking code for this device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BLb6qUKikI) but much improved.
 * Higher barometer reading freqiency thanks to my [FC_TaskPlanner library](https://github.com/JanWielgus/FC_TaskPlanner). Joop Brokking achieved about 81Hz, my code achieve almost 110Hz
